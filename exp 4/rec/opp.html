        <p>Computer Science and Engineering graduates are the pillars of the current emerging information era. Oppourtunities include pursuing Master
            of Science Programs in reputed Universities of U.S and taking up research assignments in Hardware, System Software, Computer Engineering 
            Multimedia, Networking and Communication areas.
        </p>
        <p>Job oppourtunites are even increasing and are varied in nature, System study, analysis, Design and Programming are the ingerent phases in 
            Application Development and each one of them provides enormous potential to the Computer Science and engineering graduates to shapse 
            themselves in their career. Hi-end profiles include Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Graphic Solutions and Simulations
        </p>
        <p>
            This degree program prepares students for Advanced, Technical Computer Systems Design and Development Work. It includes the study of the Database
            Dessign, Data communications, Procedural and Object oriented Programming, Operating Systems design, Algorithm Development and Applications of
            Artificial Intelligence. The curriculum includes basic course work in Electronics Technology and the Theory of Programming Languages. Students focus on developing
            computer based solutions involving hardware and software components and integration. Graduates are qualified to work in a range of positions,
            from entry-level computer scientists and system engineers to project managers leading advanced applications of computer science to real world
            problems. The department has since broadened in research strengths.
